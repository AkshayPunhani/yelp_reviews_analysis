## About

As regular Yelp users (a.k.a foodies) and compulsively obsessed with reading reviews
before trying out new restaurants/bars, we believe that categorizing them into
themes/collections would allow for easier selection. Yelp already has a layer of social
discovery, but we want to go a step further and provide information that foodies want,
but may not necessarily want to search for. For example, a user gets to see the collection
of restaurants under “restaurants with a view” if he/she wants to go eat and drink at
someplace scenic.
Our aim is to build an information organization and retrieval system for foodies to
search for restaurants on Yelp based on similarity of user reviews . Although Yelp
provides some minimal categorization, we plan to add some additional features that are
inferred from the reviews. These categories exist implicitly, but we make them explicit:
such as ‘Date Places’, ‘Sports Bars’, ‘Good Discounts’.
